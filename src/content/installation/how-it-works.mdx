# How it works
We have tried to make the project as easy as possible to run.<br />
The system allows you to generate pictures, create videos and automate them on social media.<br />
We are using 3rd party services to generate the content such as: OpenAI, Fal.ai, Replicate and Runwayml.<br />
<strong>(In the future local services such as ComfyUI)</strong>

### Each 3rd part provider can:
- Generate pictures
- Train LoRA models
- Generate LoRA pictures
- Generate videos
- Generate texts

Agent Heroes create a singular interface between all the services.<br />
You can configure the APIs of all the services as a Superadmin once you deploy the system.

## Infrastructure
The entire project is a pnpm monorepo (workspaces) and contains the following services:
- Backend is built with NestJS (default port 3000)
- Worker is built with NestJS
- Frontend is built with NextJS (default port 4200)

They are all contained inside of a docker, the backend is proxied into the frontend for easier installation:
<strong>{"http://localhost:3000/*"}</strong> ->> <strong>{"http://locahost:4200/v1/api/*"}</strong><br />
You can later just proxy port 4200 (with a reverse proxy).

We are also using Redis and Postgres for the queue and saving all the information.
